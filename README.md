# Hi there, I'm Diana! 👋🏼

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with 2+ years of professional experience building scalable web applications and features. I recently worked as a Software Engineer at Bankrate, where I contributed to mortgage and home equity products used by thousands of users daily.

I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient code and solving complex problems. Currently, I'm actively seeking opportunities as a **Frontend, Backend, or Full-Stack Software Engineer** where I can leverage my skills and continue growing as a developer.
